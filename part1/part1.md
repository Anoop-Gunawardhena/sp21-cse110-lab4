### Question 1 A ###
1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. the code returns an error because the variable 'result' is only within the scope of the if code-block
5. There should be an error in execution,since the constant variable 'result' is attempted to have its value changed in line 7
6. There should be an error in execution,since the constant variable 'result' is attempted to have its value changed in line 7

### 1B ###
1. at line 12, 3 will be printed to the console
2. at line 13, 150 will be printed to the console
3. at line 14, 150 will be printed to the console
4. the function will return [50, 100, 150] but this array isnt captured anywhere
5. this will cause an error since the value i is only i the scope of the for loop block.
6. line 13 will cuase an error because 'discountedprice' is only within the scope of the for loop block.
7. at line 14, 150 will be printed to the console
8. this function will return [ 50, 100 , 150 ], but this array isnt captured anywhere.
9. There will be an error since the for loop attempts to redeclare the const variable 'discountedprice' every iteration, also"i" is out of scope for line 11 so it cant be reached.
10. This will return 3
11. This function will return [ 50, 100 , 150 ], but this array isnt captured anywhere.
12. A. student.name
    B. student["Grad year"];
    C. student.greeting();
    D. student["Favourite Teacher"].name;
    E.student.courseLoad[0];
    
13. A. '32' because the integer 2 maps to its exact string representation and the presence of the string '3' takes precedence for the final data type which performs a concatenation 
    B. 1 because mathematical operators convert values to numbers
    C. 3, because mathematical operators convert values to numbers(null = 0)
    D. 3null,because the operation is interpreted as a concaternation between 3 and the string "null"
    E. 4, because true converted to its numerical value of 1
    F. 0, because both false and null convert to 0.
    G. 3undefined, becuase this is intepreted as a concatenation between "3" and the string "undefined"
    H. Nan, because undefind has no numerical equivalent
    
14. A. true, When comparing values of different types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers('2' to 2).
    B. false, because strings are compared letter by letter and 1 < 2.
    C. true,  When comparing values of different types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers('2' to 2).
    D. false, because === doesnt type convert when compariing(strict equality)
    E. false, because JavaScript converts true to 1.
    F. true, because a boolean conersion of any non empty variable is true
    
15.  '===' checks for strict equality and doest factr in tye conversionn if the operands are of different types, '==' converts types.

17. The resukt would be [2,4,6], because every iteratio of the for loop calls doSomething() function and fucntions can be called before they are declared.
